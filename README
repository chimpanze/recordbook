# Requirements

A running FLOW3 1.0.4 on your Webserver.

# Installation

Clone the repo into the Directory "RecordBook" under "Packages/Application/".
So the full path would be "Packages/Application/RecordBook".

`git clone git://github.com/chimpanze/recordbook.git RecordBook`

After that you can run `flow3 doctrine:update` and the database should be updated.

You can access the running RecordBook under http://yourserver/RecordBook/
